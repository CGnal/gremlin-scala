Tinkerpop 3 - the future of Gremlin-Scala
=============
This is the current development branch and it's based on Tinkerpop3. So if you're interested in the future of Gremlin-Scala, this is the right place. Both Tinkerpop3 and Gremlin-Scala are in very early stages, so don't expect much to work for now.

 here's some steps to get you started:

* install jdk 8 and configure it to be your `JAVA_HOME` and in your path (check with `echo $JAVA_HOME` and `java -version`)
* clone [Tinkerpop3](https://github.com/tinkerpop/tinkerpop3)
* build Tinkerpop3 locally (there's no publicly available builds yet): `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
* checkout Gremlin-Scala branch `tinkerpop3` and run tests. `sbt test`

Please note that due to the lack of releases of Tinkerpop3 you might get compile errors. That's because Marko and Stephen are adding test methods to test classes Gremlin-Scala implements, and we have to play catchup. 

If you would like to help, here's a list of things that needs to be addressed - if you would like to work on any of those let me know, so that we don't double up the work and I can point you in the right direction:

* fix compile errors as they come up due to changes in Tinkerpop3 (and the lack of releases in TP3)
* porting over all TP3 tests - see [TP3 testsuite](https://github.com/tinkerpop/tinkerpop3/tree/master/gremlin-test/src/main/java/com/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/graph/step) and [Gremlin-Scala StandardTests](https://github.com/mpollmeier/gremlin-scala/blob/tinkerpop3/src/test/scala/com/tinkerpop/gremlin/scala/GremlinStandardTestSuite.scala) - note that are commented out at the moment...
* getting GS to work with graph libraries other than tinkergraph - it would be great if we can provide simple sbt builds preconfigured for a specific graph db with some sample code and ready to play around using `sbt console`
* adding tests for all steps in combination with the now type safe path step (see below)
* filling this document and provide other documentation, or how-tos, e.g. a blog post or tutorial

Compile time help and fully typed traversals
=============
Gremlin-Scala aims to helps you at compile time as much as possible. Take this simple example:

```scala
GremlinScala(graph).V.outE.outE //does _not_ compile
GremlinScala(graph).V.outE.inV  //compiles
```

In Gremlin-Java or Gremlin-Groovy there's nothing stopping you to create the first (wrong) traversal - it will fail badly at runtime. 

What makes Gremlin-Scala really stand out is the full type safety of the traversal which allows us to give the developer a lot of compile-time help when building a traversal. Take this simple example:

```scala
GremlinScala(graph).V.outE.inV.value[String]("name")
```

The type of this traversal is `GremlinScala[Vertex :: Edge :: Vertex :: String :: HNil]`. If you now use the `path` step to iterate over all paths in the graph that match your traversal you will get an HList of type `Vertex :: Edge :: Vertex :: String :: HNil` for each route. For a working example see [PathSpec](https://github.com/mpollmeier/gremlin-scala/blob/tinkerpop3/src/test/scala/com/tinkerpop/gremlin/scala/PathSpec.scala)
So you get compile time safety that the first element of this Path is a Vertex, the second is an Edge etc. In Gremlin-Java or Gremlin-Groovy you just get a `List[Any]` and you have to cast the elements, as you lost the types on the way. Big kudos to the awesome [shapeless library](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/) and Scala's sophisticated type system that made this possible. 

Gremlin-Scala for Tinkerpop3
=============
TODO

A thin wrapper for Gremlin to make it easily usable for Scala Developers. 
Gremlin is a graph DSL for traversing a number of graph databases including
[Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/),
[OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/),
[DEX](http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/dex),
[InfiniteGraph](http://www.infinitegraph.com/),
[Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/),
[Rexster graph server](http://rexster.tinkerpop.com),
and [Sesame 2.0 compliant RDF stores](http://www.openrdf.org).

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mpollmeier/gremlin-scala.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mpollmeier/gremlin-scala)

For more information about Gremlin see the [Gremlin docs](http://gremlindocs.com/), [Gremlin wiki](https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki).
[Gremlin-Steps](https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Gremlin-Steps) and [Methods](https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Gremlin-Methods). 
If you have a question please check out the [Gremlin users mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gremlin-users).
Please note that while Gremlin-Scala is very close to the original Gremlin, there a slight differences to Gremlin-Groovy - don't be afraid, they hopefully all make sense to a Scala developer ;)
